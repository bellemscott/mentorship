# General Overview

Our app, Brandeis Mentorship, is a mentorship matching platform where Brandeis students, faculty and alumni can sign up to either be a mentor or a mentee. Once they sign up, they are then able to browse through a selection of mentors or mentees based on the matching algorithm. They can choose to match with any of these users and if the other person reciprocates the match, they will be able to chat with each other and decide on the logistics of the mentorship. 

We thought this app would be useful for brandesians to connect with one another with a simple, minimalist, UI.

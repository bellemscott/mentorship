If we had more time we would have added a notifications feature. Also, we would have made the screen responsive to changes, so if the user shrunk or expaned the screen, the page would responds. One of our favorite parts of the project is the explore page. We are really please with the design of the users profile. We are also very pleased with that we impemented a feature that allows users to accept and reject potential matches. This ensures that user will be satsified with their mentor or mentee. In our matching algorithm we are very proud of the jobs map we created. With around one hundred majors and around a thousand occupations, we created a hash that maps majors to jobs. This ensures that all Brandeis majors and essentailly all occupations can be matched to a mentor or mentee with common professionial interests.

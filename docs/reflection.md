# Group Reflection

## If we had more time ... 

First up on the features we wish we had time to add: the notifications feature. A lot of time spent investigating the noticed gem turned out to be fruitless, as more imminent problems came to light. The last two weeks, instead of being a time where everyone felt safe to explore new technology, became a "put out the fires" period of time.

We also would have made the screen responsive to changes, so if the user shrunk or expaned the screen, the page would respond, and thus be mobile friendly. 

## Favorite Features

One of our favorite parts of the project is the explore page. We are really pleased with the design of the users profile, as well as the UX in general. The logical flow the user experiences was absolutely a top consideration with any work we did, and if something did not fit in with a crystal clear user experience, it was immediately nixed without hesitation. 

We are also very pleased that we impemented a feature that allows users to accept and reject potential matches. In general, we put a lot of thought into the matches a user has, including thinking about edge cases. These include, but are not limited to: a user running out of matches, a user not matching on anyone initially, the necessary 2 sided relationship within a match. This last case is solved by the rejection/acceptance implementation, ensuring user satisfaction. 

Finally, our matching algorithm is code we are very proud of, particularly the matching upon common interests (mentee major <-> mentor occupation). With around one hundred majors and around a thousand occupations, the task seemed daunting. However, through a lot of hard work, we created a hash that maps majors to jobs, satisfying an accurate matching process for users.

## Our Team 

Working together was not always easy over zoom, and a group of four developers all with different skill sets working on a massive project could have been a very frustrating couple of months, if not for the amazing personalities and work ethic that our team contained. We are ultimately very proud of the product we put out, given that we all gave 100%, some at 110%. No matter what broke, who had a busy week, and who had experience in what, everyone was involved in the project and had a direct hand in Brandeis Mentorship. We, the developers, genuinely hope you enjoy the experience of Brandeis Mentorship, and want to let everyone know how much each of us learned and how impactful this project was on all of us.

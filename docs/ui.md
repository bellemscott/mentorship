# User Interface

We wanted our app to have a simple, minimalistic user interface. We first made a design of our website on balsamiq so that we could visualize how we wanted it to look. We then made various views and added css and javascript. As seen in the image below, we wanted the home page to be simple with the logo and name, with a parallax screen that has only a log in and sign up link. We made the logo on canva. Our color scheme is white, grey and the brandeis blue.

When a user is logged in, the header has 6 options; home, chat, explore, matches, profile and logout. When they first log in they are directed to the home page where they are directed to make matches (which starts the matching algorithm) and then explore those possible matches.

To browse through the users and matches, we have a bootstrap carousel where you can click through all the profiles and hover over the card to get more information.

The profile page has the users information as well as a profile edit functionality where they can upload a profile picture
